You should create a configure files in the same directory as work directory.


```toml
additional = [] # Additional configure filename
[server]
server_id = 1 # Server ID
channel_id = [1, 2] # Channel ID
privilege_group_id = 5 # Channel Privilege Group ID
redis_server = "" # Redis Server Address
leveldb = "" # LevelDB database file name/path
# track_channel_member = ""

# [mute_porter]
# enable = false
# monitor = 1
# target = 1
# Should use database ID
# whitelist = []

# [[permissions]]
# channel_id = 1
# it means set i_channel_needed_permission_modify_power to 75 and i_channel_needed_delete_power to 60
# See: https://github.com/KunoiSayami/teamspeak-autochannel.rs/wiki/Permission-List for more key information
# map = [[86, 75], [133, 60]]

[telegram]
api_key = ""
target = 0
# api_server = ""

[misc]
interval = 5 # Interval (milliseconds)

# [custom_message]
# move_to_channel = "You have been moved into your channel."

[raw_query]
server = ""  # TeamSpeak Server Address
port = 10011 # TeamSpeak ServerQuery(Raw) Port
user = "serveradmin" # TeamSpeak ServerQuery Username
password = "114514" # TeamSpeak ServerQuery Password

### Configuring the server

By default TeamSpeak's server rate limits server query commands from the same IP, and this tool requires a faster rate than the default limit. If you are running this on a machine that's different from the server (i.e. the `server` above is not localhost), you might need to whitelist the IP of the machine you run `teamspeak-management-tools`. You need to modify the file `query_ip_allowlist.txt` in your TeamSpeak server directory. If you for example runs the tools from `192.0.2.1`, you need to change this file to

```plain
127.0.0.1
::1
192.0.2.1
```

CIDR notation is supported here too; if you runs this tool in a different docker container (with docker's default networking) for example, you can use `172.16.0.0/12`.
